    "text": "PyGWalker is a python library developed by Kanaries Open Source Community.\nPyGWalker can simplify your Jupyter Notebook data analysis and data visualization workflow, by turning your pandas dataframe into an interactive user interface for visual exploration.\nPyGWalker (pronounced like “Pig Walker”, just for fun) is named as an abbreviation of “Python binding of Graphic Walker”. It integrates Jupyter Notebook with Graphic Walker, an open-source alternative to Tableau. It allows data scientists to visualize / clean / annotates the data with simple drag-and-drop operations and even natural language queries."

But hey, you realise that different states have different no of cities considered, so the states with more number of cities considered will have a higher value. so it would be better to average these out.\nHow do I do this?\nJust switch the aggregation to AVG instead of SUM.\nto use aggregation, aggregation mode must be toggled on.\nFollowing aggregations can be used: - Sum → Total of all values - Count → Number of occurrences - Median → Median of all values - Min/Max → Smallest and largest values - Standard Deviation → standard deviation of all values - Variation → variation of all values\n\n\n\n3.png"
